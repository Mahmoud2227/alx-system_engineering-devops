**Postmortem Report**: Service Outage on 5 February, 2023

**Issue Summary**:
Duration: Approximately 3 hours.

Start Time: February 5, 2023, 5:45 PM (GMT+2)

End Time: February, 2023, 8:50 PM (GMT+2)

**Impact**: User-facing applications are down and users cannot access the service during the outage. About 75% of users have been affected.

**Root Cause**: The root cause of the outage was a database issue. The database server cannot handle the increase in traffic and reaches its maximum capacity, causing an outage.

**Timeline**:
+ 5:45 PM: The problem was first identified by monitoring alerts indicating a significant increase in database server errors.
+ 6:00 PM: The incident has been forwarded to the engineering team for further investigation.
+ 6:30 PM:The team investigated the database server and discovered that it had reached its maximum capacity, causing it to crash.
+ 6:55 PM: The team tried restarting the database server, but that did not resolve the issue.
+ 7:50 PM: The team found the wrong debug path and realized that the database server was misconfigured, which was causing the problem.
+ 8:15 PM: The team fixed the configuration issue and restarted the database server.
+ 8:35 PM: The team has confirmed that the service is fully functional and the issue has been resolved.
+ 8:50 PM: The event is closed.

**Root Cause and Resolution**: The main cause of downtime is misconfiguration of the database server, which causes it to reach maximum capacity and crash. The team fixed the configuration issues and restarted the database server to resolve the issue.

**Corrective and preventive measures**:
To avoid future accidents, corrective and preventive measures will be taken:

+ perform additional monitoring and alerts to identify potential problems before they occur.
+ Review and update our database server configurations so they are optimized for our application needs.
+ Thoroughly review our incident response processes and procedures to identify areas for improvement and make necessary updates.
+ Notify all interested parties of the incident and its resolution, and provide guidance on how to report similar issues in the future.
